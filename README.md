# Project-1-WordleAgain
This game follows the rules of the popular Wordle game. This project was built with guidance from YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpby4HiElek. While the video uses plain vanilla JS, this project uses JQuery.

# Challenges
Being new to programming, the mental model for approaching the task was not intuitive to me and guidance from the Youtube video was important to help break down the task into manageable steps. 

The toughest part of the current project is to work out the logic of the colour assignment upon checking each row of inputs.
